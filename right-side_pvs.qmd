# Putting PVs and Benchmarks on the Right-Hand Side in WeMix

Here, I'm sharing an R script that serves as a wrapper for WeMix. The point is to be able to put PVs (and benchmarks) on the right-hand side of the equation, rather than the left-hand side where they normally are as response variables.

This function also conducts analysis by-group (by country in the analysis that I did). 

There are use examples at the end. 

## What The Script Does

- Wraps around WeMix to fit multilevel models where the PVs and/or benchmarks IVs
- Pools results using Rubin's (1987) rules for multiple imputation
